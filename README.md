### Initializing 
Open up any repository that you want to use 2do-cli indside.   
Then type:  
```
2do
```  
2do-cli will start, after that write :  
```
init
```   
And 2do-cli will generate a 2do.json file in you repo.  

---

### Adding a file
To work with 2do-cli you have add a file and then todos related to that.   
Lets say you have a file named `main.js` and you want to add some todos for this file, to do so (after inializing 2do-cli in your repo) you have to type:   
```
add main.js 'Here is my first todo for main.js' 
```  
After a while you might know that you want to add another todo for same file, so just use same command like:  
```
add main.js 'Here is my second todo for main.js '
```  

---

### Show todo
Now if you want to see all todos of `main.js` you simply write:    
```
show main.js
```   
and all todos of that file will appear.  

---

### Listing 
You can list all of files which have todos in current directory and select any one that you want, by typing :  
```
list
```  

---

### Removing
You can remove a file, which removes all of it's todos too, or you can only remove a todo of a file, to do prior one you just write:  
```
delete main.js
```  
And if you want to remove only second todo of this file you go like:  
```
delete main.js 2
```  
Above command will remove second todo of main.js .  

---
